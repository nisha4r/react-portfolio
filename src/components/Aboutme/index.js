                <p>Hello, I'm Nishanthi, 33 year old living at Herriman, Utah. I am a Web Developer learning Web development from Coding Bootcamp at UofU 2023 Feb Batch. I'm fueled with a passion for understanding requirements and the ability convert requirements into Web products. I am a "forever student," eager to build on my academic foundations in Web development and IT.</p>

                <p>I hunger for knowledge and am determined to learn and create the best solution for web development.</p>

                <p>I believe mindfulness in the workplace is crucial to successâ€”a tenet. I live out my self-interests in yoga, meditation, gardening, and painting. I'm currently working as a homemaker and am always interested in challenges. Reach out to nisha.4r@gmail.com to connect!</p>
